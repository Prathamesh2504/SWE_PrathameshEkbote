📡 Project Overview
The Satellite Data Pipeline is a comprehensive, large-scale data processing system designed to handle terabyte to petabyte-scale satellite data for space agencies and research institutions. This mission-critical system ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability while processing real-time satellite feeds from multiple sources across the globe.

🎯 Problem Statement
Space agencies face significant challenges in managing the exponential growth of satellite data:
Volume Challenge: Processing 10+ TB of satellite data daily from multiple satellites
Velocity Challenge: Real-time ingestion of streaming data with sub-second latency requirements
Variety Challenge: Handling diverse data formats (HDF5, NetCDF, GeoTIFF) from different satellite types
Reliability Challenge: Ensuring 99.9% uptime for mission-critical space operations
Security Challenge: Protecting sensitive satellite data with multi-layered security
Scalability Challenge: System must scale horizontally to handle 10x data growth
